# Archived / duplicate directories

These directories remain for reference but are superseded by the canonical stack in this folder:

- `SystemDashboard-1/` – legacy listener + Flask UI; use `Start-SystemDashboard.Unified.ps1` instead.
- `wwwroot/` + `Start-SystemDashboard.ps1` – older stub listener; moved to `_archive/root-scripts/` alongside the legacy zips.
- Archived repositories have their `.github` folders renamed to `.github.archive` to avoid CI/editor lint noise.
- Archived repositories also have `.git` renamed to `.git.archive` to prevent VS Code from treating them as active repos.
- `telemetry/` replaces the WindSurf telemetry repo (`SystemDashboard_WindSurf/SystemDashboard`).
- `tools/EventLogExplorer/` replaces the standalone `GeminiSystemDashboard` copy in the repo root.
